- Understand booking and cancellation trends  
- Compare booking patterns between city hotels and resort hotels  
- Analyze customer behavior such as lead time, length of stay, and repeat bookings  
- Identify key factors that influence booking cancellations  

The insights gained can support better decision-making in pricing, marketing, and operational planning.
